I actually want to create this long time ago. But I think if I created this
during Hacktoberfest, I would encourage people to contribute this.


It's created for Hacktoberfest last minute PR. You can contribute to the applicationn itself
or created Krathong for us to choose. There is no competition or contest here. However, Hacktoberfest
discourage bad PR so please put some effort into the contribution.
